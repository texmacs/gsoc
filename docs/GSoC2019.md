# GSoC 2019 (Proposal)

## Ideas List

There is a list of ideas discussed in the email:

### Converters (Easy)
+ Descriptions
  * Between TeXmacs and OpenOffice/LibreOffice/M$Office.
  * Extending the HTML converters to HTML 5.
  * Between TeXmacs and Markdown(CommonMark)
+ Outcomes
  * Improve the converters for GNU TeXmacs
+ Skills: C++ and Scheme
+ Possible Mentors: Joris van der Hoeven, Massimiliano Gubinelli, Darcy Shen

### Language tools (Medium)
+ Descriptions
  * Automatic grammar checking
  * Built-in translation facilities (could be interface to Google translate).
+ Outcomes
  * Improve GNU TeXmacs as a tool for authors and translators
+ Skills: C++ and Scheme
+ Possible Mentors: Joris van der Hoeven, Massimiliano Gubinelli, Darcy Shen

### Further improvement of blibliographic tools (Medium)
+ Descriptions
  * Direct searching of bib entries on the web from within TeXmacs.
  * Automatic linking of authors to homepages, bib entries to Pdfs, etc.
  * Preview of link targets in help balloons.
+ Outcomes
  * Improve GNU TeXmacs for academic purpose
+ Skills: C++ and Scheme
+ Possible Mentors: Joris van der Hoeven, Massimiliano Gubinelli

### Plugins (Medium)
+ Descriptions
  * integrate jupyter interface
+ Outcomes
  * Improve the REPLs for GNU TeXmacs
+ Skills: C++ and Scheme
+ Possible Mentors: Joris van der Hoeven, Massimiliano Gubinelli, Darcy Shen

See [plugins](https://github.com/texmacs/plugins) for more info.

### Scheme (Hard)
+ Descriptions
  * port TeXmacs to Guile 2 (or make the scheme code independent of the specific scheme system, while avoiding perfomance regressions)
+ Outcomes
  * Make GNU TeXmacs independent of a specific scheme impl
+ Skills: C++ and Scheme
+ Possible Mentors: Joris van der Hoeven, Massimiliano Gubinelli, Darcy Shen

See [TimScheme](https://github.com/texmacs/TimScheme) for more info.

### GUI (Medium)
+ Descriptions
  * develop an experimental wkwidgets port to evaluate transition to that library
+ Outcomes
  * Make GNU TeXmacs independent of a specific GUI Framework
+ Skills: C++ and Scheme
+ Possible Mentors: Joris van der Hoeven, Massimiliano Gubinelli, Darcy Shen

### Graphics (Hard)
+ Descriptions
  * improve the drawing system, maybe evaluate also possible alternative for a (canonical, standard) procedural graphics system (like tikz or metapost) to  be included in TeXmacs (the reason is that some graphs are more meaningfully programmed than drawn via the UI
+ Outcomes
  * Make GNU TeXmacs an awesome tool for drawing
+ Skills: C++ and Scheme
+ Possible Mentors: Joris van der Hoeven, Massimiliano Gubinelli

There are more ideas available in the [Gitter](https://gitter.im/texmacs/Lobby) chat room. You are welcome to come up with new ideas and discuss with us.
