# FAQ
+ Q: The code base of GNU TeXmacs is too large, where to start?

   A: The [plugins](https://github.com/texmacs/plugins) subproject is a good start point.

+ Q: Where to submit a Pull Request?

  A: [texmacs](https://github.com/texmacs/texmacs) and [plugins](https://github.com/texmacs/plugins) are preferred. And once it is accepted, we will commit the changes with your full name.

+ Q: Why not use C++ standard library?

  A: GNU TeXmacs is twenty years old at least. C++ standard library evolves. If we use it, we have to follow it. For a relatively large code base, it is a good idea to avoid the usage of standard libraries.
